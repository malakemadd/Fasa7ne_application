    <string name="paragraph">It is ultimately cozy, homely cultural place where you can enjoy a cup of coffee and a snack with a good read from the used/ rare interesting books.</string>
    <string name="paragraph2">It is a wonderful boat included in the Amer Group Restaurants, which are famous and present all kind of food, including seafood, Egyptian and Italian food, with high quality service and delicious unique tastes.</string>
    <string name="review1">The park is very nice. There are much less games compared to Dream park for example. But the machines/games are in a good shaped and well-maintained.\n\n
The park is more superior to any other amusement park when it comes to photos and beautiful scenes.\n\n
In my opinion, it is so expensive and overpriced. I believe that is why it was not crowded even in weekends.</string>
    <string name="review2">I liked the place and spent lovely time there. But it\'s a little bit over priced. You can use some promotions on tickets using waffarha app. The offer ends by the end of october so HURRY UP!!</string>
    <string name="brief1">Away from the hustle and bustle of the real world, a park was designed to give you the feeling of a luxurious kind of fun. Zed Park Sheik Zayed is more than just a park; it is the first amusement park in Egypt that matches the universal standards.</string>
